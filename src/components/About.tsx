              HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Han Xiao , a passionate <b>Software Engineer</b> based
              in <b>Melbourne, Australia</b>. My role involves designing and
              implementing scalable solutions that ensure optimal performance
              and user experience. I am also a collaborative team player with a
              passion for learning.

            <p>
              Beyond the realm of technology, I am also a home foodie, finding
              joy and inspiration in the culinary arts. Experimenting with
              flavors, exploring diverse cuisines, and honing my culinary skills
              are endeavors that bring me immense satisfaction. Much like in
              software development, I approach cooking with creativity and
              precision, delighting in the process of crafting delicious dishes
              that bring people together and create memorable experiences.
